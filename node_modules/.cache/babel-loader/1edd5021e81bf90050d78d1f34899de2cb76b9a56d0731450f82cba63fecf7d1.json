Early Days: CSS1 and Basic Styling\n   CSS1 (1996):`, `Introduction: CSS1 was introduced to separate content from presentation, allowing HTML to focus on structure while CSS handled styling.\n   Basic Features: CSS1 provided fundamental styling capabilities such as font properties, text color, background color, and basic box model properties (margins, borders, padding).\n   Limited Layout Control: Early CSS had minimal layout control, primarily relying on HTML tables for complex layouts.`, `2. CSS2: Enhanced Styling and Layout\n   CSS2 (1998):`, `New Features: CSS2 introduced more sophisticated styling options, including relative, absolute, and fixed positioning, z-index for stacking elements, and the @media rule for different media types.\n   Improved Layouts: CSS2 allowed for better layout control with features like float and clear, enabling developers to create multi-column layouts without using tables.\n   Print Styles: The addition of print-specific styles improved the ability to create print-friendly web pages.`, `3. CSS3: Modular Approach and Advanced Capabilities\n   CSS3 (2011):`, `Modularization: CSS3 was broken down into modules, allowing for more flexible and faster development and implementation of new features.\n   Advanced Selectors: New selectors, such as attribute selectors, pseudo-classes (e.g.,\n   ,\n   ), and pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before, ::after), provided greater control over element styling.\n   Animations and Transitions: CSS3 introduced transitions, animations, and keyframes, enabling developers to create dynamic effects without relying on JavaScript.\n   Media Queries: Media queries revolutionized responsive design by allowing styles to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.\n   Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox): Flexbox made it easier to create complex, flexible layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.`, `4. Modern CSS: Grid Layout, Variables, and Beyond\n   CSS Grid Layout (2017):`, `Two-Dimensional Layouts: CSS Grid provided a powerful two-dimensional layout system, enabling developers to create intricate grid-based designs with ease.\n   Grid Tracks and Areas: Features like grid tracks, grid areas, and grid templates allowed for precise control over the placement and alignment of elements.\n   CSS Variables (Custom Properties):\n   \n   Dynamic Styling: CSS Variables introduced the ability to define reusable values (variables) that can be dynamically changed, improving maintainability and theming capabilities.\n   Subgrid and Enhancements:\n   \n   Subgrid: The subgrid feature extends the capabilities of CSS Grid by allowing nested grids to inherit grid lines from their parent grids, promoting more consistent layouts.\n   Newer Specifications:\n   \n   CSS Houdini: Houdini aims to give developers lower-level access to the CSS rendering engine, enabling more powerful and efficient custom styling and layout techniques.\n   Container Queries: Container queries allow styles to be applied based on the size of a container rather than the viewport, providing more granular control over responsive designs.`]\n}, {\n  name: 'deploy',\n  title: 'Developing Real-Time Applications with Node.js',\n  date: '10 min',\n  author: 'shiva868',\n  img: 'https://cdn.hdwebsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Thiet-ke-chua-co-ten-3.jpg.webp',\n  content: [`Node.js has emerged as a popular platform for developing real-time applications due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.

This essay explores the major milestones in the evolution of CSS, highlighting how it has advanced from basic styles to facilitating sophisticated layouts and responsive designs.`,\r\n   `1. Early Days: CSS1 and Basic Styling\r\n   CSS1 (1996):`,\r\n   `Introduction: CSS1 was introduced to separate content from presentation, allowing HTML to focus on structure while CSS handled styling.\r\n   Basic Features: CSS1 provided fundamental styling capabilities such as font properties, text color, background color, and basic box model properties (margins, borders, padding).\r\n   Limited Layout Control: Early CSS had minimal layout control, primarily relying on HTML tables for complex layouts.`,\r\n   `2. CSS2: Enhanced Styling and Layout\r\n   CSS2 (1998):`,\r\n   `New Features: CSS2 introduced more sophisticated styling options, including relative, absolute, and fixed positioning, z-index for stacking elements, and the @media rule for different media types.\r\n   Improved Layouts: CSS2 allowed for better layout control with features like float and clear, enabling developers to create multi-column layouts without using tables.\r\n   Print Styles: The addition of print-specific styles improved the ability to create print-friendly web pages.`,\r\n   `3. CSS3: Modular Approach and Advanced Capabilities\r\n   CSS3 (2011):`,\r\n   `Modularization: CSS3 was broken down into modules, allowing for more flexible and faster development and implementation of new features.\r\n   Advanced Selectors: New selectors, such as attribute selectors, pseudo-classes (e.g.,\r\n   ,\r\n   ), and pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before, ::after), provided greater control over element styling.\r\n   Animations and Transitions: CSS3 introduced transitions, animations, and keyframes, enabling developers to create dynamic effects without relying on JavaScript.\r\n   Media Queries: Media queries revolutionized responsive design by allowing styles to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.\r\n   Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox): Flexbox made it easier to create complex, flexible layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.`,\r\n   `4. Modern CSS: Grid Layout, Variables, and Beyond\r\n   CSS Grid Layout (2017):`,\r\n   `Two-Dimensional Layouts: CSS Grid provided a powerful two-dimensional layout system, enabling developers to create intricate grid-based designs with ease.\r\n   Grid Tracks and Areas: Features like grid tracks, grid areas, and grid templates allowed for precise control over the placement and alignment of elements.\r\n   CSS Variables (Custom Properties):\r\n   \r\n   Dynamic Styling: CSS Variables introduced the ability to define reusable values (variables) that can be dynamically changed, improving maintainability and theming capabilities.\r\n   Subgrid and Enhancements:\r\n   \r\n   Subgrid: The subgrid feature extends the capabilities of CSS Grid by allowing nested grids to inherit grid lines from their parent grids, promoting more consistent layouts.\r\n   Newer Specifications:\r\n   \r\n   CSS Houdini: Houdini aims to give developers lower-level access to the CSS rendering engine, enabling more powerful and efficient custom styling and layout techniques.\r\n   Container Queries: Container queries allow styles to be applied based on the size of a container rather than the viewport, providing more granular control over responsive designs.`,\r\n\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'deploy',\r\n    title: 'Developing Real-Time Applications with Node.js',\r\n    date: '10 min',\r\n    author: 'shiva868',\r\n    img: 'https://cdn.hdwebsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Thiet-ke-chua-co-ten-3.jpg.webp',\r\n    content: [\r\n\r\n      `Node.js has emerged as a popular platform for developing real-time applications due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
