From simple styling of HTML elements to enabling complex layouts and dynamic designs, CSS has evolved to become a powerful tool in web development. This essay explores the major milestones in the evolution of CSS, highlighting how it has advanced from basic styles to facilitating sophisticated layouts and responsive designs.`,\r\n   `1. Early Days: CSS1 and Basic Styling\r\n   CSS1 (1996):`,\r\n   `Introduction: CSS1 was introduced to separate content from presentation, allowing HTML to focus on structure while CSS handled styling.\r\n   Basic Features: CSS1 provided fundamental styling capabilities such as font properties, text color, background color, and basic box model properties (margins, borders, padding).\r\n   Limited Layout Control: Early CSS had minimal layout control, primarily relying on HTML tables for complex layouts.`,\r\n   `2. CSS2: Enhanced Styling and Layout\r\n   CSS2 (1998):`,\r\n   `New Features: CSS2 introduced more sophisticated styling options, including relative, absolute, and fixed positioning, z-index for stacking elements, and the @media rule for different media types.\r\n   Improved Layouts: CSS2 allowed for better layout control with features like float and clear, enabling developers to create multi-column layouts without using tables.\r\n   Print Styles: The addition of print-specific styles improved the ability to create print-friendly web pages.`,\r\n   `3. CSS3: Modular Approach and Advanced Capabilities\r\n   CSS3 (2011):`,\r\n   `Modularization: CSS3 was broken down into modules, allowing for more flexible and faster development and implementation of new features.\r\n   Advanced Selectors: New selectors, such as attribute selectors, pseudo-classes (e.g.,\r\n   ,\r\n   ), and pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before, ::after), provided greater control over element styling.\r\n   Animations and Transitions: CSS3 introduced transitions, animations, and keyframes, enabling developers to create dynamic effects without relying on JavaScript.\r\n   Media Queries: Media queries revolutionized responsive design by allowing styles to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.\r\n   Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox): Flexbox made it easier to create complex, flexible layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.`,\r\n   `4. Modern CSS: Grid Layout, Variables, and Beyond\r\n   CSS Grid Layout (2017):`,\r\n   `Two-Dimensional Layouts: CSS Grid provided a powerful two-dimensional layout system, enabling developers to create intricate grid-based designs with ease.\r\n   Grid Tracks and Areas: Features like grid tracks, grid areas, and grid templates allowed for precise control over the placement and alignment of elements.\r\n   CSS Variables (Custom Properties):\r\n   \r\n   Dynamic Styling: CSS Variables introduced the ability to define reusable values (variables) that can be dynamically changed, improving maintainability and theming capabilities.\r\n   Subgrid and Enhancements:\r\n   \r\n   Subgrid: The subgrid feature extends the capabilities of CSS Grid by allowing nested grids to inherit grid lines from their parent grids, promoting more consistent layouts.\r\n   Newer Specifications:\r\n   \r\n   CSS Houdini: Houdini aims to give developers lower-level access to the CSS rendering engine, enabling more powerful and efficient custom styling and layout techniques.\r\n   Container Queries: Container queries allow styles to be applied based on the size of a container rather than the viewport, providing more granular control over responsive designs.`,\r\n\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'deploy',\r\n    title: 'Developing Real-Time Web-Applications with Node.js',\r\n    date: '10 min',\r\n    author: 'shiva868',\r\n    img: 'https://cdn.hdwebsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Thiet-ke-chua-co-ten-3.jpg.webp',\r\n    content: [\r\n\r\n      `Node.js has emerged as a popular platform for developing real-time applications due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
